# About me
My name is Netra, and I am a highly stressed, 12th grader currently attending Jamnabai Narsee School. I am an avid reader and writer and try to spend time each week writing my book (it’s a work in progress). If you asked me what my role in a friend group is, it would be that annoying reader who never shuts up about books. I spend my time trying to think of bad jokes and try to curb my sarcasm as much as I can.

My favourite genre to read and write is Fantasy. Some of my favourite books include Six of Crows, To Kill a Kingdom, The Poppy War, City of Brass and The Hunger Games. I aspire to become a published fantasy author in the future, hopefully something which is not too far away. I love singing and playing football and am currently pursuing Grade 8 Trinity in Rock and Pop Vocals.

I was the lead scriptwriter for my school’s interhouse dramatics competition, which we won first place in. I am a published author with Scholastic writer’s academy and am in the process of publishing a research paper on the effect of music on our brains. I also co-wrote the script for a Street play for the 2019 Eco fest, which won first place. I rsn a Book Donation drive called Books to Benefit with my friend Teesha. It is a social initiative where we collect pre-loved books and then sell them. All the money we collect is donated to Angel Xpress which is used to fund the education of underprivileged children.

I currently reside in Mumbai with my sarcastic dream and anxiety filled head.
